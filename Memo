What is React.memo?

React.memo is a Higher Order Component (HOC) that remembers the last rendered output of a component.
It works only with functional components
It does a shallow comparison of props
If props are the same → no re-render

React.memo is used to optimize functional components by preventing unnecessary re-renders using shallow comparison of props.
---------------------------------------------
Example
Without memo
----------------
function Child({ count }) {
  console.log("Child rendered");
  return <h2>Count: {count}</h2>;
}
Every time the parent renders, Child also re-renders, even if count is the same.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
With memo
import React from "react";

const Child = React.memo(({ count }) => {
  console.log("Child rendered");
  return <h2>Count: {count}</h2>;
});

export default Child;

Now  Child renders only when count changes 
--------------------------------------------
Use memo when:

Your component renders often
It receives the same props frequently
It has heavy UI or expensive calculations
--------------------------------------------
1.Why do we use React.memo?
Answer: We use React.memo to improve performance by avoiding re-rendering a component when its props remain the same.
2.Which components can use React.memo?
Answer: Only functional components can use React.memo.
 3.How does React.memo work internally?
Answer: It performs a shallow comparison of previous and current props.
        If props are equal → re-render is skipped.
 4.What is shallow comparison?
Answer: Shallow comparison checks only the top-level values of props, not deep nested objects.
5.Real-world use case of React.memo?
Answer:  Large lists
         Tables
         Dashboards
         Child components receiving same props repeatedly
