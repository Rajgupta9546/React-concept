What is State?

State is a built-in object that stores data which can change over time inside a component.

State is used when a component needs to update and re-render itself.

Think of state like a variable inside a component that React watches.

Key Points about State

Managed inside the component

Mutable (can be changed using setState / useState)

When state changes, UI updates automatically

Used for dynamic data (counter, form input, toggle, etc.)
