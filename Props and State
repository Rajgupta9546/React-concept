What is State?

State is a built-in object that stores data which can change over time inside a component.

State is used when a component needs to update and re-render itself.

Think of state like a variable inside a component that React watches.

Key Points about State

Managed inside the component
Mutable (can be changed using setState / useState)
When state changes, UI updates automatically
Used for dynamic data (counter, form input, toggle, etc.)

What is propes?

Props (short for properties) are read-only objects used in React to pass data and configuration from a
parent component to a child component.

They allow components to be dynamic, reusable, and customizable, while maintaining 
one-way data flow (from parent to child).

Key Points about State

Props are passed from parent to child
Props are immutable (cannot be modified by the child)
Props help in component reusability
Props support unidirectional data flow
