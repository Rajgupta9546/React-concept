  What is components in react?
  
  Components are the building blocks of a React application.
  A component is a reusable piece of UI that defines how a part of the screen looks and behaves.
  components like functions that return HTML (JSX).
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why Components?

Reusability (use same UI multiple times)
Easy to manage and maintain
Clean and organized code
Each component handles its own logic and UI

Example
(Function Component)
function Welcome() {
  return <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;
}

Welcome is a component
It returns JSX
Can be reused anywhere
-------------------------------------------
-> Two types of Components in React

1.Function Components (Modern & Recommended)

Simple JavaScript functions
Can use Hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.)

function Greeting() {
  return <p>Welcome to React</p>;
}

️2. Class Components (Older Way)

Use ES6 classes
More code, no longer preferred

import React from "react";

class Greeting extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <p>Welcome to React</p>;
  }
}
